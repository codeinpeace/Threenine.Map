What is Threenine.Map
*********************

Threenine.Map is a code library to enable easier and leaner object-object mapper. Under the hood it makes use of the most popular C# object-object mapper  `Automapper 
<http://automapper.org/>`_. 

Object-object mapping works by transforming an input object of one type into an output object of a different type. 

What makes AutoMapper interesting is that it provides some interesting conventions to take the dirty work out of figuring out how to map type A to type B. As long as type B follows AutoMapper's established convention, almost zero configuration is needed to map two types.
